# ui5\_async\_load\_with\_promise

> Test loading ui5 asynchronously (preload=async) with a ES6 Promise used to wait for UI5 to load

This is just a very basic test of ES6 Promises (which are avaiable in Chrome version 22+). Its the standard tiles app as generated by the OpenUI5 Yeoman generator but we wrap the async event for the UI5 core load in a Promise.

Generated by Yeoman: generator-openui5.
